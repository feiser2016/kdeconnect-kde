/**
 * Packet used for simple telephony events
 *
 * It contains the key "event" which maps to a string indicating the type of event:
 *  - "ringing" - A phone call is incoming
 *  - "missedCall" - An incoming call was not answered
 *
 * Historically, "sms" was a valid event, but support for that has been dropped in favour
 * of the SMS plugin's more expressive interfaces
 *
 * Depending on the event, other fields may be defined
